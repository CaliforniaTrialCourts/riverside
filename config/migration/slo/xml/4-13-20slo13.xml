	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;e&quot;&gt;E&lt;/h2&gt;

Courts of law are rigid and must act strictly according to the law.&lt;/li&gt;

Also, in criminal cases, a rule which prevents witnesses from observing each other testify or from discussing &lt;a href=&quot;#testimony&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; during the course of the proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;

The witnesses are ordered not to discuss their &lt;a href=&quot;#testimony&quot;&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; with each other and may be held in contempt if they violate the order.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;

The parol &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; rule limits the admissibility of parol &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; which would directly contradict the clear meaning of terms of a written &lt;a href=&quot;#contract&quot;&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Each party to a suit tried to a jury has the right to peremptorily &quot;challenge&quot; (reject) a certain number of prospective jurors without giving a reason. By contrast, the &lt;a href=&quot;#parties&quot;&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; have unlimited rights to challenge jurors for good cause, but the judge must approve &quot;for cause challenges.&quot; Parties may not exercise peremptory challenges on the basis of race or gender.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

The court and the &lt;a href=&quot;#defendant&quot;&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt; must approve of any settlements. For example, a guilty &lt;a href=&quot;#plea&quot;&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; may be exchanged for a lesser &lt;a href=&quot;#charge&quot;&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; or a sentencing recommendation, or for dismissal of one or more of the &lt;a href=&quot;#charge&quot;&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;s in a multi count &lt;a href=&quot;#information&quot;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt;, or for dismissal of another case.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;prejudicialevidence&quot;&gt;prejudicial evidence&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Evidence which might unfairly sway the judge or jury to one side or the other. For example, photographs of a gory murder scene might inflame a jury without providing useful &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;. May be excluded in criminal cases if prejudicial effect outweighs probative value.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

If the judge determines there is sufficient &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;#defendant&quot;&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;bound over&quot; for &lt;a href=&quot;#trial&quot;&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;#defendant&quot;&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href=&quot;#waive&quot;&gt;waive&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href=&quot;#hearing&quot;&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;An investigation conducted at the request of the court after a person has been found guilty of a crime.

No &lt;a href=&quot;#plea&quot;&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; is entered at this stage. If, after the preliminary &lt;a href=&quot;#hearing&quot;&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;, the case is bound over to the District Court, the &lt;a href=&quot;#defendant&quot;&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt; will enter a &lt;a href=&quot;#plea&quot;&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=&quot;#arraignment&quot;&gt;arraignment&lt;/a&gt; in District Court.

Its use is limited in theory to cases in which the cause of the plaintiff's injury was entirely under the control of the &lt;a href=&quot;#defendant&quot;&gt;defendant&lt;/a&gt;, and the injury presumably could have been caused only by &lt;a href=&quot;#negligence&quot;&gt;negligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The protection of one's person or property against some injury attempted by another. The law of &quot;self defense&quot; justifies an act done in the reasonable belief of immediate danger.

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Notifying a person that he or she has been named as a party to a lawsuit or has been accused of some offense.

	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;sovereignimmunity&quot;&gt;sovereign immunity&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The doctrine that a government or governmental agency cannot be sued without consent.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;specificperformance&quot;&gt;specific performance&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;

In criminal and &lt;a href=&quot;#delinquency&quot;&gt;delinquency&lt;/a&gt; cases, the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard. In civil cases and neglect and dependency proceedings, the lowest standard applies by a mere preponderance of the &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; (more likely than not). In some civil cases, and in juvenile proceedings such a permanent termination of parental rights, an intermediate standard applies: proof by clear and convincing &lt;a href=&quot;#evidence&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;staredecisis&quot;&gt;stare decisis&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The doctrine that, when a court has once laid down a principle of law applicable to a certain set of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to future cases where the facts are substantially the same. This is a defining characteristic of the common law system followed in the U.S., Great Britain, and a few other nations.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;A certain time allowed by &lt;a href=&quot;#statute&quot;&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; in which litigation must be brought. In criminal cases, prosecution is barred if not brought within the &lt;a href=&quot;#statute&quot;&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; of limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;stay&quot;&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;A stopping or arresting of a judicial proceeding by order of a court (e.g., a stay of enforcement of a judgment).&lt;/li&gt;

This &lt;a href=&quot;#hearing&quot;&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; is held outside of the presence of the jury, either prior to or at &lt;a href=&quot;#trial&quot;&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;.

		<field name="headerh1">Family</field>
		<field name="division">Family</field>
		<field name="body">Mission\n\nTo assist parents of minor age children in reorganizing their family following separation or divorce in a manner that will enable the children to continue having healthy relationships with both parents.\n\nMediation\n\nMediation is required by California State law when parents are in disagreement about the custody of their child/ren. Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.\n\nFor more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.\n\nMediation by Phone\n\nFamily Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County. All telephone mediations must be approved by FCS prior to the scheduled appointment. For telephonic mediations a Mediation Intake Form (see below) must be received by the parent pre-approved to call in at least 24 hours prior to the appointment time.\n\nThe intake form can be faxed to 805-706-3608 or mailed to the FCS address:\n\n        Family Court Services\n        901 Park Street\n        Paso Robles, CA, 93446\n\nMediation is for parents only\n\nNew spouses, significant other relationships and extended family members are not to be included unless previously approved by Family Court Services. Children are not included unless previously arranged by Family Court Services. Please contact FCS prior to your appointment if you wish to have a support person present because of domestic violence or if you have any questions about who is to attend mediation in your particular matter. Please do not bring your children to mediation. \n\nMediation Documents\n\n\n	Mediation Intake Form\n	Mediation Orientation\n	Mediation Exit Survey\n	Domestic Violence and Child Custody\n\n\nDomestic Violence and Restraining Orders\n\nIn cases involving domestic violence, mediation is conducted in a manner to protect all the parties. Family Court Services\' policy is to meet with each party separately. FCS schedules each appointment at separate times. FCS\'s goal is to protect all parties during the mediation experience in order to create the best possible environment to help families develop parenting plans with as little conflict as possible and with the highest level of satisfaction possible.\n\nChild Custody Evaluations\n\nNINOS: EL DESAFIO DEL DIVORCIO\n\n\nREGISTRO:  Llame a la oficina de antemano a los Servicios de la Corte de Relaciones Familiares para registrarse y obtener informacion, al numero 805-226-3251.  Debe tener disponible el numero del caso civil o del divorcio para darselo al secretario.  Clases en espanol son ofrecidas, y son citadas de acuerdo con los registrados.\n\nCOSTO:  gratis\n\nEste programa satisface los requisitos del programa de educacion antes de que se le otorga las ordenes judiciales para finalizar el caso.\n\n\nIn cases with ongoing unresolved disputes between parents, the Court may order a child custody evaluation. The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents in a manner that best serves his/her needs.\n\nTo accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent\'s historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child\'s functioning and developmental needs and the child\'s wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent\'s functional ability to meet the child\'s needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.\n\nSome evaluations are much more limited in scope than others.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mission&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist parents of minor age children in reorganizing their family following separation or divorce in a manner that will enable the children to continue having healthy relationships with both parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mediation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediation is required by California State law when parents are in disagreement about the custody of their child/ren. Mediation is a process of assisting parents in developing a parenting plan and is a neutral setting for discussing arrangements for the children, and to reduce acrimony and provide guidelines for parenting after separation or divorce. Mediation is a means of settling parenting disputes outside of court. Each parent is given the opportunity to be heard, and the objective is to develop parenting plans that meet the needs of the child/ren. Mediation is confidential from the Court process, and the mediator does not make recommendations to the Court if the parents are in disagreement. If an agreement is reached, the stipulation/agreement is submitted to the Court only after the parties have agreed in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information regarding the procedures for scheduling a mediation appointment, contact Family Court Services between the hours of 8:30 am and 4 pm on Monday through Thursday at (805) 706-3608.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mediation by Phone&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family Court Services can accommodate requests for long distance and out of state telephone mediation for parents who reside outside San Luis Obispo County. All telephone mediations must be approved by FCS prior to the scheduled appointment. &lt;strong&gt;For telephonic mediations a &lt;em&gt;Mediation Intake Form &lt;/em&gt;(see below) must be received by the parent pre-approved to call in at least 24 hours prior to the appointment time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intake form can be faxed to 805-706-3608 or mailed to the FCS address:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;Family Court Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        901 Park Street&lt;br&gt;
        Paso Robles, CA, 93446&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mediation is for parents only&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New spouses, significant other relationships and extended family members are not to be included unless previously approved by Family Court Services. Children are not included unless previously arranged by Family Court Services. Please contact FCS prior to your appointment if you wish to have a support person present because of domestic violence or if you have any questions about who is to attend mediation in your particular matter. &lt;strong&gt;Please do not bring your children to mediation. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Domestic Violence and Restraining Orders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases involving domestic violence, mediation is conducted in a manner to protect all the parties. Family Court Services' policy is to meet with each party separately. FCS schedules each appointment at separate times. FCS's goal is to protect all parties during the mediation experience in order to create the best possible environment to help families develop parenting plans with as little conflict as possible and with the highest level of satisfaction possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Este programa satisface los requisitos del programa de educacion antes de que se le otorga las ordenes judiciales para finalizar el caso.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In cases with ongoing unresolved disputes between parents, the Court may order a child custody evaluation. The evaluation is conducted by a court appointed evaluator. The focus of a child custody evaluation is to assess the individual and family factors that affect the best interests of the child/ren. The primary purpose and function of a child custody evaluation is to gather information about the family in a comprehensive and unbiased manner, and to report back to the court with a recommendation for a parenting plan that will help the child/ren maintain relationships with both parents in a manner that best serves his/her needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this end, a child custody evaluation usually includes (1) an assessment of each parent's historical involvement and current capacities for parenting and their ability to manage conflict; (2) an assessment of the child's functioning and developmental needs and the child's wishes where appropriate; and (3) an assessment of each parent's functional ability to meet the child's needs, which includes evaluation of the interaction between each adult and child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some evaluations are much more limited in scope than others. This will be described in the evaluation order. Your evaluator will review the process for your family during your first appointment with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a custody evaluation is ordered by the court for your family, please be sure to read through the order carefully.  We need your help to get things started, and the order will give you directions on how to proceed.  Contact Family Court Services with any questions at 805-706-3608.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an ordered custody evaluation only, we require that each parent fill out the following forms and deliver them to Family Court Services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/documents/san-luis-obispo/FCS_Intake_form.pdf&quot;&gt;Family Court Services Intake Form&lt;/a&gt; (AKA: Custody evaluation personal data sheet)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/documents/san-luis-obispo/Release_of_information_2.pdf&quot;&gt;Release of Information&lt;/a&gt;
	​&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; For full evaluations, please complete a release of information form for each treatment professional who is working with or has recently worked with you and your children (IE: schools, therapists, pediatricians). For partial evaluations you only need to complete release of information forms for those professionals outlined in your order.
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the court has ordered that the evaluation only consist of interviewing your children, then you will need to turn in the following form to Family Court Services instead of the forms outlined above:&lt;/p&gt;

The clerks do not have forms for filing an appeal.\n\nOn a decision of the Superior Court, the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days after the mailing or personal service of the entry of judgment. If a Notice has not been mailed or personally served, the appeal period is 180 days from the entry of judgment by the court. Permission to file late is rarely given. Filing of a notice of appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;General Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probate is the court-supervised process for identifying and gathering a decedent’s assets, paying taxes, debts, and expenses and distributing the balance to beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conservatorship is a court proceeding where a judge appoints a responsible person or organization to care for another adult who cannot care for him/herself or his/her finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before letters of conservatorship can be issued by the clerk, a proposed conservator must view a video and have read the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/handbook.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Handbook for Conservators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, now available online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardianships are protective proceedings where the court gives a responsible person the custody of a minor or power to manage the minor’s property, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forms to initiate a guardianship case are available in our &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-guardianship.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Guardianship self-help page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wills -&lt;/strong&gt; The clerk's office will accept wills after the person who wrote it is deceased. There is a $50 fee for lodging a will with the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following applies to wills, trusts, conservatorships and guardianships:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filing fee for a petition for probate is listed on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/StatewideCivilFeeSchedule-20160101.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;court’s fee schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anything requiring a hearing, an additional $30 fee for court reporting services lasting under one hour is required pursuant to section 68086(a)(1)(A) of the Government Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All probate matters are filed and heard at the Civil &amp;amp; Family Law Branch in San Luis Obispo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gi/contact-location.htm#branch_civil&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil &amp;amp; Family Law Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Probate Appeals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an appeal, a higher court reviews the order or judgment of a lower court. Any party may appeal from an unfavorable decision based upon whether there was enough evidence to support the judgment or whether errors of law were committed during or before trial which harmed the appealing party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fee for filing an appeal on a Superior Court decision is $775.00. The clerks do not have forms for filing an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a decision of the Superior Court, the notice of appeal must be filed within 60 days after the mailing or personal service of the entry of judgment. If a Notice has not been mailed or personally served, the appeal period is 180 days from the entry of judgment by the court. Permission to file late is rarely given. Filing of a notice of appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment. You must still comply with all court orders.&lt;br&gt;

            Does every estate have to go through probate?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;There are many situations where an estate does not require formal probate. Even when formal probate is not required, some form of legal process is often necessary. This is especially true when an estate owns an interest in real property.&lt;/p&gt;

            What is the filing fee for a Petition for Probate?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;The fee for filing a Petition for Probate is $435.00. The fee for filing an Objection or Response to a Petition for Probate is $435.00. Certain subsequent petitions relating to probate are also $435.00. Please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;/ff/schedules.htm&quot;&gt;fee schedule&lt;/a&gt; for updated fee changes.

	&lt;li&gt;and hit and run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These violations are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; handled by the Traffic court. They may be misdemeanors or felonies, and they are heard in the &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/criminal.htm&quot;&gt;Criminal Courts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misdemeanor offenses are typically punishable by up to a year in jail, by a fine not exceeding $1,000 (plus assessment and fees), or both. (Specific California laws may raise these limits for some offenses.)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mandatory Appearance?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some violations require a mandatory appearance in court; others may be handled by mail or on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mandatory appearance violations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These require your appearance in court on the date/time/location indicated on your Citation/Courtesy Bail Notice. You will be required to appear in court before paying your fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fail to appear in court by the due date indicated on your Courtesy Bail Notice and did not request an extension, you may be subject to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An additional Failure to Appear charge which is a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine, or jail, or both.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A civil assessment of up to $300.00 pursuant to PC1214.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Department of Motor Vehicles may revoke or suspend your driver's license, and/or withhold its issuance or renewal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Non-Mandatory Appearance Violations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Courtesy Bail Notice does not indicate Mandatory Appearance, your options are to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay the traffic ticket&lt;/strong&gt; prior to your required appearance date. The traffic ticket will remain on your driving record.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attend Traffic School.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm#eligibility&quot;&gt;Eligibility Requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appear in Court&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are unable to appear at the date and time indicated on your citation or Courtesy Notice, contact the traffic office for a single 30 day extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I set a court date?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wish to appear before a judge or court commissioner, you must check in with the clerk in the Traffic Department at the location indicated on your citation, no later than the appearance date stated, to be placed on the court calendar. &lt;em&gt;If you are under 18 years of age, your case is automatically set on calendar. No check-in is required. Your appearance location and time should be noted on the bottom of your citation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your appearance date, place, and time are indicated on your copy of the citation, and on your courtesy bail notice. (The officer who issued your citation will not be present.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your citation has been filed with the court by the citing agency, you may appear prior to your due date that is noted on the bottom of your citation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorts, tank tops, bare feet, and other inappropriate attire are &lt;a href=&quot;#court_conduct&quot;&gt;not allowed&lt;/a&gt; in the courtroom.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appearing in Court&lt;a name=&quot;appearing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you appear in traffic court, the first appearance is for &lt;strong&gt;Arraignment&lt;/strong&gt;, which is when you enter a plea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge will ask that you step before the bench and confirm your understanding of the charges. If you do not understand, the charges and the potential consequences in the event of conviction will be read to you. Thereafter, you are asked which plea you want to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several pleas you can enter; the most common are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Guilty Plea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you plead guilty you can give the judge an explanation about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;No Contest Plea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same as a guilty plea &lt;em&gt;except &lt;/em&gt;if you are involved in a civil suit (arising from your actions the citation was issued for) - such as a traffic accident - a no contest plea cannot be used against you in a later civil proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the judicial officer reduces your fine, he or she can order it be paid immediately, and, considering your prior convictions and any facts in aggravation, can increase the fine over the bail amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Not Guilty Plea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge will order your case scheduled for trial to determine your innocence or guilt. &lt;strong&gt;You will be notified by mail of your court trial date and time to appear. It is your responsibility to assure that the court does have your correct mailing address and a phone number where you can be contacted. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not give an explanation at arraignment since the facts will be covered at your trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Appearing in Court on a Failure to Appear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your case is in a Failure to Appear status, you must post FULL bail plus penalty assessment(s) in order to be placed on calendar. In order to receive a release of your Failure to Appear hold on your driving record &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; your court appearance, you must pay by cash, credit/debit card or money order. Payment by personal check will delay the release of your Failure to Appear hold.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conduct During Court Proceedings&lt;a name=&quot;court_conduct&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During court you are expected to sit quietly and refrain from talking, chewing gum, reading newspapers, or other behavior that would distract the court and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorts, tank tops, and other inappropriate attire are not permitted and you will not be allowed to appear if so dressed. Hats are not to be worn in the courtroom. No food, drinks, or weapons of any kind are allowed in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;

When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a “Subpoena Duces Tecum” – which means, basically, Subpoena “bring with you”.\n\nIn CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125.\n\nWhat Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?\n\nA Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.\n\nA Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.\n\nIf you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the “Custodian of Records” – or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the “Custodian of Records” who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.\n\nHow Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?\n\nIn cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called “pro per”), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.\n\nYou can download the Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk’s office for issuance. Once there, tell the clerk that you need to get the subpoena issued, give them the form and ask for a signature and stamp.\n\nOnce a Subpoena is Issued by the Court Clerk, It Must Be Personally Served on the Witness or Custodian.\n\nTo be enforceable, a Subpoena must be personally handed to the person it is directed to. Defendants cannot serve the Subpoena themselves. There must be an Independent Person to Serve the Subpoena such as the Sheriff’s Department Process Service.\n\nOnce a Subpoena is served, the server must fill out the attached “Proof of Service” so the service can be verified in court.\n\nThere are time limits to serving a subpoena so that the witness or custodian has time to get ready.  At least 10 days is required for most things or witnesses.</field>

&lt;p&gt;At your trial, the officer who issued the citation will testify as a witness. If there are other witnesses, they may also be called to testify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the trial you may question (cross-examine) the witnesses. You may testify yourself and / or call witnesses to testify.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial by Written Declaration&lt;/strong&gt; – This option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained on our forms page, by mail, or in person. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Court Trial&lt;/strong&gt; – This option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail. If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) misdemeanor charge may be added against you, which bears a $300.00 assessment and a driver’s license suspension until resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;#plead_not_guilty&quot;&gt;Pleading Not Guilty&lt;/a&gt;, above.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;Subpoena&quot; name=&quot;Subpoena&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; What is a Subpoena?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Subpoena is actually an order from the Court telling a person to either show up in court, or to bring something to court. When a Subpoena is directed to a person to appear in court, it is called a personal subpoena. When it is used to get a thing into court (like a photograph or sign), it is called a “Subpoena Duces Tecum” – which means, basically, Subpoena “bring with you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In CA there is a mandatory form for Criminal and Traffic Court subpoenas that is published by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr125.pdf&quot;&gt;Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What Sort of Things Does a Subpoena Work For?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Traffic Court Defendant in California can use a Subpoena to require any witness to appear in court. This includes police, bystanders who saw what happened, passengers, the person who maintains the machine, or the tow truck driver who impounded the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Subpoena can also be used to get things into trial such as photos, maintenance records, radar guns, video recordings, paperwork, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to force a thing to come to court, you have to direct the subpoena to the “Custodian of Records” – or the person who is known to have possession or control over the item. Most large businesses and government agencies (including the CHP) have a person designated as the “Custodian of Records” who is responsible for responding to subpoenas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How Does a Defendant Representing Themselves Get a Subpoena Issued?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where a defendant represents themselves, (called “pro per”), the Defendant has the right to use a Subpoena, but they must get the court clerk to sign the completed Subpoena Form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cr125.pdf&quot;&gt;Judicial Council Subpoena Form CR-125&lt;/a&gt;. Then fill in as much information as possible and take it in person to the clerk’s office for issuance. Once there, tell the clerk that you need to get the subpoena issued, give them the form and ask for a signature and stamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Once a Subpoena is Issued by the Court Clerk, It Must Be Personally Served on the Witness or Custodian.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be enforceable, a Subpoena must be personally handed to the person it is directed to. Defendants cannot serve the Subpoena themselves. There must be an Independent Person to Serve the Subpoena such as the Sheriff’s Department Process Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a Subpoena is served, the server must fill out the attached “Proof of Service” so the service can be verified in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are time limits to serving a subpoena so that the witness or custodian has time to get ready.  At least 10 days is required for most things or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

		<field name="body">Your Courtesy Bail Notice\n\nThe Court sends you a Courtesy Bail Notice once we receive your citation. (It may take an agency 2-3 weeks to get us your citation info.) The Courtesy Notice provides information about how to handle your ticket, including:\n\n\n	Bail amount you owe\n	Due date when payment must be made\n	Traffic School eligibility criteria\n	\&quot;Fix-It\&quot; ticket information: how to clear a proof of correction violation\n	Court appearances: where and when to report, should you choose to do so\n\n\nTake action on the citation by its listed due date. Not receiving your Courtesy Bail Notice is not a legal excuse for failing to resolve the citation on time. Allow 10 days for delivery and processing when submitting anything by mail.\n\nThe DMV may suspend your driver’s license if you fail to appear or take action by the citation\'s due date. This DMV hold will restrict your ability to renew your driver\'s license or attend traffic school.\n\nThe court may refer your case to collections which may add up to $300.00 in civil assessment fees if you fail to pay your fines on time.\n \n\nPaying the Citation\n\nFinancial Hardship or Ability to Pay\n\nTo ask the Court to consider your ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or community service, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk\'s office.\n\nMethods of Payment\n\nThe Court accepts credit or debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, and Discover), personal checks, money orders, cashier’s checks, and cash\n\n\n	Mail the payment (check or money order, do not mail cash) to the Traffic Processing Center:\n\n	\n		Make the payment payable to the SLO Superior Court.\n		Write your docket number on the check or money order. Your case number can be found at the top right-hand corner of your courtesy bail notice directly under the print date.\n		If you do not have the court\'s case number, you may write your citation number on your payment.\n		Mail your payment to:\n		\n		        Traffic Processing Center\n		        1050 Monterey Street Room 222\n		        San Luis Obispo, CA, 93408 USA\n		 \n	\n	\n	Pay in person with check, cash, money order, Visa, or MasterCard at:\n	 \n	\n	Paso Robles Branch\n	901 Park Street\n	Paso Robles CA 93446\n	Monday - Friday\n	8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n	 \n\n	San Luis Obispo Branch\n	1050 Monterey Street, Rm 220\n	San Luis Obispo, CA 93408\n	Monday - Friday\n	8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n	 \n\n	Grover Beach Branch\n	216 S. 16th Street\n	Grover Beach, CA 93433\n	Monday - Friday\n	8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n	 \n	\n	\n	\n	\n\n\nIf you are wishing to post bail and contest your citation, you must contact the clerk\'s office prior to payment either by phone or by correspondence. Failure to contact the clerk\'s office prior to payment will result in your case being closed. This is ONLY necessary if you are intending on pleading NOT GUILTY.\n\nIf you have appeared in Court and were granted Traffic School with a new total amount due, that amount does reflect the Traffic School fee. Your case will or has been continued with a Traffic School due date.\n\nNOTE: The Court\'s vendor charges an additional Administrative Fee on all credit card payments.\n\nIt is your responsibility to make sure payment is actually received by the Court prior to your appearance date.\n\nA $30.00 charge will be added on all returned checks.\n\nPaying Bail\n\nBail is the dollar amount associated with the code section you were cited for noted on your citation. If you choose to pay the bail on the citation without going to your arraignment or trial, it is a bail forfeiture. The citation is deemed paid, and the resulting conviction will be reported to DMV if you were cited for a reportable violation. Some violations require a mandatory court appearance and cannot simply be paid.\n\nIf there are mechanical or insurance violations included in the citation, the Court requires you to submit proof of correction before any reduction in bail can be applied. If you do not provide proof of correction, the total bail amount must be paid. Proof may be submitted either by mail or in person.\n \n\nRequesting an Extension\n\nThe Clerk’s Office may give one 30-day court appearance or due date extension. Make a request in-person or call one of our court locations listed below:\n\n\n\n\nPaso Robles Branch\n901 Park Street\nPaso Robles CA 93446\nMonday - Friday\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n \nPhone: (805) 706-3600\nMonday - Thursday Only\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n \n\n\nSan Luis Obispo Branch\n1050 Monterey Street, Rm 220\nSan Luis Obispo, CA 93408\nMonday - Friday\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n \nPhone: (805) 706-3600\nMonday - Thursday Only\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrover Beach Branch\n216 S. 16th Street\nGrover Beach, CA  93433\nMonday – Friday\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n \n\n\nPhone: (805) 706-3600\nMonday – Thursday Only\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPayment Alternatives\n\nFor a person who wants community work service instead of paying a fine or for those who just want more time to pay, the clerk of the Court is authorized to accept a written plea of guilty at the counter (or by mail) and continue the case for payments. This procedure is known as a “Counter Arraignment” and is designed to save time and effort of sitting through a court session. This option is also available for payment of Traffic School fees.\n\nA defendant who enters a guilty plea in writing at the clerk’s office will be given the options to request a one-time 90 day extension for a $30 time extension fee or they may request monthly payments of $50/$100 per month for a $35 payment plan fee. This option is also available for Traffic School fees.\n\nFine can be satisfied by completing community work service or some combination of work and fine. There is a required minimum payment due when the Counter Arraignment is signed.\n \n\nProof of Correction\n\nHow to obtain Proof of Correction for Mechanical, Registration, License and Insurance Violations (“fix-it tickets”):\n\nThe citing officer must allege on the citation that the violation is correctable. Violations marked with an asterisk on your courtesy bail notice designate correctable violations.\n\nAdvisement: Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution. \n\nA photo copy of the signed off citation is not acceptable; unless, the submitted citation is a copy with an original signature of Law Enforcement or DMV. \n\nMechanical Violations\n\nProof of correction violations (required under VC40610) will be dismissed once the following have occurred (if taken care of in a timely manner).\n\n\n	The item is corrected (e.g. the tail light is fixed).\n	An authorized representative signs the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice certifying it was corrected.\n	The signed citation is submitted with a mandatory Fix-it Fee to the court.\n\n\nAuthorized representatives include:\n\n\n	All California Law Enforcement agencies\n	Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)\n	(for license and registration issues)\n	Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.\n\n\nMany agencies charge a fee to sign the cite; this is different than the State Administration Fix-it Fee required by the court.\n\nIf you are delinquent in appearing, proof of correction will probably not reduce the bail or fine.\n\nRegistration and License Violations\n\nIf you are charged with a violation of the registration law, you must show proof to the Court that the vehicle has been registered, junked, or receipted as planned non-operation after the date of citation. A $25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due. If proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it is dated with DMV prior to the violation date the $25 Fix-it Fee is waived.\n\nYou may have DMV \&quot;Sign-Off\&quot; the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status \&quot;Non-Op\'d\&quot;.\n\nIf you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice. You may also provide a copy of your driver\'s license to the court. Sign-off only qualifies if the violation is filed as an \&quot;infraction\&quot; and the citing officer allows for correction. \n\nInsurance Violations\n\nIf you were charged with a violation of the proof of financial responsibility law (VC16028), the Court will dismiss the charge only if it is shown that the defendant was financially responsible (i.e. there was an insurance policy that covered the defendant/driver on the date of violation, or proof the the vehicle was insured at the time of the violation). A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court.\n\nIf you purchase a 6 month insurance policy after the violation date and your name is on the policy, the court will suspend half of the bail amount due that carries with that violation (VC16028(a)).\n\nAdvisement: Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution\n\nWhat if I no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable?\n\nIf you no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable, it is still your responsibility to clear the citation by either paying the bail or appearing in court. If you have junked the car or it is deemed inoperable, you will need to show proof of a DMV junk certificate or planned non-operation receipt to the Court. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court. (if applicable)\n\nAm I responsible for an equipment violation on a car I am driving that is not mine?\n\nYes, unless the ticket is issued in the name of the registered owner of the vehicle you are driving. It is not an excuse that it was not your vehicle; it is still your responsibility to clear the citation if the citation is issued in your name.\n \n\nTraffic School\n\nSee these pages for more details:\n\nTraffic School Information - Eligibility Requirements\n\nList of Traffic Schools\n\nTraffic School Not Completed - What Can I Do?\n\nPetition the court to request to attend Traffic School.\n\nIn order to qualify for this petition process, you must submit your request within 30 days of the date your case was closed. Submission after 30 days is considered tardy and will not be accepted.\n\nOnce you have filled out your reason why the court should consider your request and submitted it timely to the court, your petition will be reviewed for consideration by our Traffic Commissioner.\n\nIf granted, you will be given time to complete Traffic School. Once proof is shown to the court, your driving record will be updated to reflect a confidential Traffic School conviction. (a masked report with D.M.V.)\n\nIf denied, there will either be conditions that are ordered or no further action required.\n\nClick on Forms &amp; Filing tab at the top of the page. The Traffic Department forms are at the bottom of the page. You can download form # TR01 - Traffic Petition and mail it to the San Luis Obispo address.\n \n\nGetting More Help\n\nCourt staff is authorized to provide information regarding the procedures used by the court to process a case.\n\nHowever, all court staff are prohibited by law (Government Code Section 24004) from giving legal advice to litigants or to assist them in filling out any forms, including forms provided by the court, for the following reasons:\n\n\n	\n	Court staff are not attorneys. The clerical staff is trained to accept papers for filing and has no expertise in the legal consequences of information included on any of the forms.\n	\n	The court must be neutral in any proceeding. By assisting one side or the other, court staff can cause the court to be perceived as taking sides or being biased.\n\n\nAll persons seeking legal assistance from the clerk’s office are to be directed to an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California without naming any specific person or firm.</field>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your Courtesy Bail Notice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court sends you a Courtesy Bail Notice once we receive your citation. (It may take an agency 2-3 weeks to get us your citation info.) The Courtesy Notice provides information about how to handle your ticket, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Bail amount you owe&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Due date when payment must be made&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Traffic School eligibility criteria&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&quot;Fix-It&quot; ticket information: how to clear a proof of correction violation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Court appearances: where and when to report, should you choose to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take action on the citation by its listed due date. &lt;strong&gt;Not receiving your Courtesy Bail Notice is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a legal excuse&lt;/strong&gt; for failing to resolve the citation on time. Allow 10 days for delivery and processing when submitting anything by mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DMV may suspend your driver’s license if you &lt;strong&gt;fail to appear or take action&lt;/strong&gt; by the citation's due date. This DMV hold will restrict your ability to renew your driver's license or attend traffic school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court may refer your case to collections which may add up to $300.00 in civil assessment fees if you fail to pay your fines on time.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;paying&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paying the Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Financial Hardship or Ability to Pay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ask the Court to consider your ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or community service, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk's office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Methods of Payment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court accepts credit or debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, and Discover), personal checks, money orders, cashier’s checks, and cash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail the payment&lt;/strong&gt; (check or money order, &lt;strong&gt;do not mail cash&lt;/strong&gt;) to the Traffic Processing Center:

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Make the payment payable to the &lt;em&gt;SLO Superior Court&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Write your docket number on the check or money order. Your case number can be found at the top right-hand corner of your courtesy bail notice directly under the print date.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;If you do not have the court's case number, you may write your citation number on your payment.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Mail your payment to:&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;br&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;        Traffic Processing Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
		        1050 Monterey Street Room 222&lt;br&gt;
		        San Luis Obispo, CA, 93408 USA&lt;br&gt;
		 &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay in person&lt;/strong&gt; with check, cash, money order, Visa, or MasterCard at:&lt;br&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are wishing to post bail and contest your citation, you must contact the clerk's office prior to payment either by phone or by correspondence. Failure to contact the clerk's office prior to payment will result in your case being closed. This is ONLY necessary if you are intending on pleading NOT GUILTY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have appeared in Court and were granted Traffic School with a new total amount due, that amount does reflect the Traffic School fee. Your case will or has been continued with a Traffic School due date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The Court's vendor charges an additional Administrative Fee on all credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is your responsibility to make sure payment is actually received by the Court prior to your appearance date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A $30.00 charge will be added on all returned checks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Paying Bail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bail is the dollar amount associated with the code section you were cited for noted on your citation. If you choose to pay the bail on the citation &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; going to your arraignment or trial, it is a bail forfeiture. The citation is deemed paid, and the resulting conviction will be reported to DMV if you were cited for a reportable violation. Some violations require a mandatory court appearance and cannot simply be paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are mechanical or insurance violations included in the citation, the Court requires you to submit &lt;a href=&quot;#poc&quot;&gt;proof of correction&lt;/a&gt; before any reduction in bail can be applied. If you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; provide proof of correction, the total bail amount must be paid. Proof may be submitted either by mail or in person.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Requesting an Extension&lt;a name=&quot;extension&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Payment Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a person who wants &lt;strong&gt;community work service&lt;/strong&gt; instead of paying a fine or for those who just want &lt;span&gt;more time to pay, the clerk of the Court is authorized to accept a written plea of guilty at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;counter (or by mail) and continue the case for payments. This procedure is known as a “&lt;strong&gt;Counter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arraignment&lt;/strong&gt;” and is designed to save time and effort of sitting through a court session. This option is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;also available for payment of Traffic School fees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defendant who enters a guilty plea in writing at the clerk’s office will be given the options to request a one-time 90 day extension for a $30 time extension fee or they may request monthly payments of $50/$100 per month for a $35 payment plan fee. This option is also available for Traffic School fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine can be satisfied by completing &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-communityservice.htm&quot;&gt;community work service&lt;/a&gt; or some combination of work and fine. There is a required minimum payment due when the Counter Arraignment is signed.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Proof of Correction&lt;a name=&quot;poc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to obtain Proof of Correction for Mechanical, Registration, License and Insurance Violations (“fix-it tickets”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citing officer must allege on the citation that the violation is correctable. Violations marked with an asterisk on your courtesy bail notice designate correctable violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisement:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo copy of the signed off citation is not acceptable; unless, the submitted citation is a copy with an original signature of Law Enforcement or DMV. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mechanical Violations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proof of correction violations (required under VC40610) will be dismissed once the following have occurred (if taken care of in a timely manner).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The item is corrected (e.g. the tail light is fixed).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;An authorized representative signs the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice certifying it was corrected.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The signed citation is submitted with a mandatory Fix-it Fee to the court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorized representatives include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All California Law Enforcement agencies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)&lt;br&gt;
	(for license and registration issues)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many agencies charge a fee to sign the cite; this is different than the State Administration Fix-it Fee required by the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are delinquent in appearing, proof of correction will probably not reduce the bail or fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Registration and License Violations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are charged with a violation of the registration law, you must show proof to the Court that the vehicle has been registered, junked, or receipted as planned non-operation &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the date of citation. A $25 State Mandated Fix-it fee will also be due. If proof of Release of Liability is submitted and it is dated with DMV &lt;strong&gt;prior &lt;/strong&gt;to the violation date the $25 Fix-it Fee is waived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have DMV &quot;Sign-Off&quot; the violation on the back of your citation or you may submit a copy of your registration, proof of your junked or dismantled vehicle or proof the vehicle has been placed in non-operational status &quot;Non-Op'd&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are charged with a license violation you may have the DMV sign off the back of your citation or sign your Courtesy Bail Notice. You may also provide a copy of your driver's license to the court. &lt;strong&gt;Sign-off only qualifies if the violation is filed as an &quot;infraction&quot; and the citing officer allows for correction. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Insurance Violations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were charged with a violation of the proof of financial responsibility law (VC16028), the Court will dismiss the charge only if it is shown that the defendant was financially responsible (i.e. there was an insurance policy that covered the defendant/driver &lt;strong&gt;on the date of violation, or proof the the vehicle was insured at the time of the violation)&lt;/strong&gt;. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you purchase a 6 month insurance policy &lt;strong&gt;after &lt;/strong&gt;the violation date and &lt;strong&gt;your name &lt;/strong&gt;is on the policy, the court will suspend half of the bail amount due that carries with that violation (VC16028(a)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisement: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fraudulent or altered documentation may be referred to the Office of the District Attorney for a full investigation and possible criminal prosecution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What if I no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you no longer own the vehicle or it is inoperable, it is still your responsibility to clear the citation by either paying the bail or appearing in court. If you have junked the car or it is deemed inoperable, you will need to show proof of a DMV junk certificate or planned non-operation receipt to the Court. A Fixit-Fee is payable to the Court. (if applicable)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Am I responsible for an equipment violation on a car I am driving that is not mine?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, unless the ticket is issued in the name of the registered owner of the vehicle you are driving. It is not an excuse that it was not your vehicle; it is still your responsibility to clear the citation if the citation is issued in your name.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Traffic School&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See these pages for more details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm&quot;&gt;Traffic School Information&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm#eligibilty&quot;&gt;Eligibility Requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctsi-courtnetwork.org/&quot;&gt;List of Traffic Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Traffic School Not Completed - What Can I Do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petition the court to request to attend Traffic School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to qualify for this petition process, you must submit your request within 30 days of the date your case was closed. Submission after 30 days is considered tardy and will not be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have filled out your reason why the court should consider your request and submitted it timely to the court, your petition will be reviewed for consideration by our Traffic Commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If granted, you will be given time to complete Traffic School. Once proof is shown to the court, your driving record will be updated to reflect a confidential Traffic School conviction. (a masked report with D.M.V.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If denied, there will either be conditions that are ordered or no further action required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on Forms &amp;amp; Filing tab at the top of the page. The Traffic Department forms are at the bottom of the page. You can download form # TR01 - Traffic Petition and mail it to the San Luis Obispo address.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting More Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court staff is authorized to provide information regarding the procedures used by the court to process a case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all court staff are prohibited by law (Government Code Section 24004) from giving legal advice to litigants or to assist them in filling out any forms, including forms provided by the court, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Court staff are not attorneys. The clerical staff is trained to accept papers for filing and has no expertise in the legal consequences of information included on any of the forms.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The court must be neutral in any proceeding. By assisting one side or the other, court staff can cause the court to be perceived as taking sides or being biased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All persons seeking legal assistance from the clerk’s office are to be directed to an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California without naming any specific person or firm.&lt;/p&gt;

The State of California and the County of San Luis Obispo have also adopted laws which add an assessment to the amount of the fine.\n\nWhen you appear in court, the judge may impose any fine between the minimum and maximum based upon the facts of your case and your record of prior convictions.\n\nIf the judge becomes aware that you have prior convictions, the fine imposed in court can be more than the bail. The Judicial Council recommends an increase for each prior conviction up to the maximum permitted by law.\n\nIf your ticket includes a correctable violation, see Proof of Correction.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Who do I make my check out to?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Make checks out to SLO Superior Court.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            When is my court date?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Your court date is the date on the bottom of your citation.

Trial by Written Declaration\nThis option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance. Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained by mail or from our forms page. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision.\n\n2. Court Trial\nThis option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations. A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail.\n\nIf you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) charge may be added against you, which bears an additional penalty fee and a driver’s license suspension until resolved.\n\nFor more information, see What happens when I plead not guilty?.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            What if I disagree with the outcome of my trial?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Any party may appeal an unfavorable decision made in the trial court to the appellate division of the superior court. The appeal must be directed towards errors of law only. An appeal is not a retrial, and you will not be permitted to introduce new evidence. You are advised to thoroughly read California Rules of Court, rules 8.702-8.709 and rules 8.780-8.793. The court clerks cannot assist you. You should direct any questions you have to an attorney of your own choosing.\n\nForms for an appeal are available from the clerk\'s office (Judicial Council forms TR-150, TR-155, TR-160, TR-165) or online at the CA Courts website. Choose Traffic Infractions from the Category drop down menu then click the Search button. The Notice of Appeal from a Court Trial must be filed within 30 days of the judgment date.\n\nFiling a Notice of Appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment. You must still comply with all terms and conditions of the court order.\n\nTo appeal a Trial by Declaration decision, complete and file a Request for New Trial/Trial De Novo (Judicial Council Form TR-220) with the Court within 20 days of the mailing of judgment.</field>

&lt;p&gt;To ask the Court to consider yor ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/collections-communityservice.htm&quot;&gt;community work service&lt;/a&gt;, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk's office.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appearing in Court&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The date that appears on your case that are noted on this website &lt;em&gt;do not always &lt;/em&gt;reflect your actual appearance date. &lt;/strong&gt;Always contact the Clerk's Office or the Traffic Processing Center to confirm your court appearance whether it be for Arraignment or Trial, if needed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-appearance.htm&quot;&gt;First time appearances are called Arraignments&lt;/a&gt;. The citing officer is not present at the Arraignment. If you intend to plead Not Guilty to your citation, you will return for an actual trial with the citing officer present at the same time. The court will notify you of a date and time to appear for your trial. If you have posted bail for your trial prior to your Arraignment date either by mail or at the clerk's office, a trial date and time will be mailed to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is your responsibility to provide your current address and phone number to assure proper notification to you of your trial date and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have not received notification from the court regarding your Arraignment date or a Trial date, please contact the court to verify your appearance date and time.&lt;/p&gt;

            How soon can you deal with my ticket?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;It generally takes a week to ten days for the court to receive a ticket and another 5-10 business days to enter and process it. Once entered into the court's system, a Courtesy Notice is mailed to the address listed on the citation.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court can quote bail and give you information regarding your citation &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the citation has been filed by the issuing agency &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; entered into the court's computers.&lt;/p&gt;

            How do I take care of a fix-it ticket?
        &lt;/a&gt;

            Financial Hardship or Ability to Pay
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;To ask the Court to consider your ability to pay due to financial hardship and decide whether to approve a reduced fine with a payment plan or community service, you may schedule an appearance in Court for arraignment without the deposit of bail by contacting the clerk's office.&lt;/p&gt;

            Why is there a proof of correction fee?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the officer states there is no fee for correctable &quot;fix-it&quot; violations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State of California requires the court to collect a proof of correction processing fee (Fix-it Fee) per Vehicle Code § 40611 (which is statutory) for all correctable violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statutory fees apply even if the infraction itself carries no fine.&lt;/p&gt;

            Can I pay my traffic ticket online?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.slocourts.net/traffic/citation_info/&quot;&gt;Pay your ticket in full&lt;/a&gt;, 24 hours a day, with a Visa or Mastercard. You will be charged a nominal processing fee for this service.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our ticket information section does not answer your questions, you may call us by phone or by appearing at the clerk's office at any of our branch locations listed under &lt;strong&gt;Contact Information&lt;/strong&gt; on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any holds&lt;/strong&gt; on your driving record &lt;strong&gt;will be released on the next business day&lt;/strong&gt; after making your payment in full with these options.&lt;/p&gt;

            How much is my ticket?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Fines will vary based on violations alleged and/or judge's decisions if a court appearance is made.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the amount due is the bail required for each violation &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; any applicable assesments and fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California legislature enacts minimum and maximum fines for all violations of state law; fines for local laws are enacted by the Board of Supervisors or City Councils. The State of California and the County of San Luis Obispo have also adopted laws which add an assessment to the amount of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you appear in court, the judge may impose any fine between the minimum and maximum based upon the facts of your case and your record of prior convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the judge becomes aware that you have prior convictions, the fine imposed in court can be more than the bail. The Judicial Council recommends an increase for each prior conviction up to the maximum permitted by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your ticket includes a correctable violation, see &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-tickets101.htm&quot;&gt;Proof of Correction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            When is my court date?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Your court date is the date on the bottom of your citation. If the citation does not have a court date listed, the court will issue one and will include it on the Courtesy Bail Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

            Do I have a warrant?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Warrants are not usually issued on Traffic Infractions. Punishment for an infraction is a fine only.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do not take care of your traffic citation&lt;/strong&gt; in a timely manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a hold may be placed on your driver's license by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV),&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;your license may be suspended, and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;civil assessment of up to $300.00&lt;/strong&gt; may be added to the bail amount currently due.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            Am I eligible for Traffic School?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm#eligibility&quot;&gt;Eligibility Requirements&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State of California has set forth &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm&quot;&gt;Traffic School&lt;/a&gt; eligibility requirements in California Rule of Court 4.104. These rules determine under what conditions and in which cases a person may attend Traffic School in order to receive a confidential traffic school conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This court will permit attendance at a Department of Motor Vehicles certified Traffic School as a means of obtaining a confidential traffic school conviction if you meet the &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-school.htm#eligibility&quot;&gt;Eligibility Requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            What if I disagree with the ticket the officer wrote, what can I do?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;You have two options available to you:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Trial by Written Declaration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This option is for infraction violations only and does not require a personal appearance. You may request a Trial by Written Declaration which requires you to post bail in lieu of your appearance. Instructions and forms for a Trial by Written Declaration may be obtained by mail or from our forms page. Submit the Trial by Written Declaration form with any facts or evidence you wish to have considered. A written statement will be requested from the citing officer(s). A judicial officer will review your case and you will be notified by mail of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Court Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This option requires a court appearance and is available for all violations. A Court Trial requires you to post bail if you do not appear for arraignment. Posting bail pursuant to VC40519(b) constitutes a waiver of your right to a speedy trial within 45 days. Send a check or money order for the total bail or appear for an arraignment and enter your plea after which the court will set your trial date and notice you by mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you fail to appear at the time designated for your trial, either a trial in your absence will occur (Trial in Absentia), or a VC40508(a) charge may be added against you, which bears an additional penalty fee and a driver’s license suspension until resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;/dv/traffic-contestcitation.htm#plead_not_guilty&quot;&gt;What happens when I plead not guilty?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            What if I disagree with the outcome of my trial?
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Any party may appeal an unfavorable decision made in the trial court to the appellate division of the superior court. The appeal must be directed towards errors of law only. An appeal is not a retrial, and you will not be permitted to introduce &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; evidence. You are advised to thoroughly read California Rules of Court, rules 8.702-8.709 and rules 8.780-8.793. The court clerks cannot assist you. You should direct any questions you have to an attorney of your own choosing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forms for an appeal are available from the clerk's office (Judicial Council forms TR-150, TR-155, TR-160, TR-165) or online at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm&quot;&gt;CA Courts website&lt;/a&gt;. Choose &lt;strong&gt;Traffic Infractions&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Category&lt;/strong&gt; drop down menu then click the &lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt; button. The Notice of Appeal from a Court Trial must be filed within &lt;strong&gt;30 days&lt;/strong&gt; of the judgment date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filing a Notice of Appeal does not stop enforcement of the judgment. You must still comply with all terms and conditions of the court order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To appeal a Trial by Declaration decision, complete and file a Request for New Trial/Trial De Novo (Judicial Council Form TR-220) with the Court within &lt;strong&gt;20 days&lt;/strong&gt; of the mailing of judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Court Reporter Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court will provide an Official Court Reporter to in forma pauperis litigants in civil and family law matters upon request for the following types of hearings: family law trials, family support hearings, family law requests for order, hearings on requests for civil or family law restraining orders, unlimited jurisdiction civil trials, civil law and motion, probate, conservatorships, guardianships, and mental health proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be eligible for a court reporter, the litigant must have an order granting a fee waiver on file in the case.  In matters that do not require a filing fee, such as requests for civil or family law restraining orders, a party who is eligible for a waiver of fees must file a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fw001.pdf&quot;&gt;Request to Waive Court Fees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party requesting a court reporter must file and serve the request no later than seven (7) days prior to the scheduled hearing, with notice to all parties. A failure to file a timely request may be considered a waiver of a court reporter for the scheduled hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not eligible for a fee waiver and wish your matter to be reported, you must hire a reporter privately and are responsible for all fees and costs related to the reporting services. Please call (805) 706-3605 to request a list of private court reporters or court reporting agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/documents/san-luis-obispo/Court_Reporter_Notice_and_Request.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Court Reporter Notice &amp;amp; Request Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;purchase&quot; name=&quot;purchase&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Purchasing a Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When purchasing a transcript, the person or party is contracting with an individual court reporter for the actual transcript of the proceedings, pursuant to Government Code Section 69950.  Transcript costs are governed by the code and all arrangements for preparation, delivery and payment of transcript are between the requesting party and the individual court reporter.  Official court reporters may be contacted directly by telephone or by email as indicated on the list below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attorneys or private citizens who have a need for the written record of a public court proceeding may purchase a transcript directly from the court reporter who reported the hearing.  The interested party should personally contact the court reporter and make arrangements for the preparation of the transcript.  The following information will be required before a transcript can be prepared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Case number&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Case name&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Date(s) of hearing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Name of the judge or courtroom in which the hearing was held&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please specify if you are requesting the entire hearing, or a specific portion of the transcript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/documents/san-luis-obispo/wrequest.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Transcript Request Form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of the court reporter who reported the hearing can be found on the Case Summary for that hearing, which is prepared by the courtroom clerk.  You may view or purchase a copy of the Case Summary at the clerk’s office during regular office hours (8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.).  You may contact the court reporter directly by telephone, email, or fill out a “Request for Transcript” form, which is available in the clerk’s office or may be downloaded from this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcripts are purchased on a per-page basis, as governed by Government Code Section 69950.  The court reporter will contact you with an estimate of the cost of the transcript.  The court reporter will not release the transcript until payment has been received.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

There is evidence that the courts of that time summoned a body of sworn neighbors to put before the court crimes which had come to their knowledge. During the reign of Henry II (1154-1189) the Assize of Clarendon (1166) established the \&quot;jury of presentment\&quot;of twelve \&quot;good and lawful men\&quot; assembled to reveal the names of those suspected of crimes.\n\nThe connection to our present grand jury system is clear. It was also during the reign of Henry II that juries divided into two types: civil and criminal, with the development of each influencing the other. The Massachusetts Bay Colony impaneled the first grand jury on our soil in 1635 to consider cases of murder, robbery and wife beating. By the end of the colonial period, the grand jury had become an important adjunct of government: \&quot;they proposed new laws, protested against abuses in government, and wielded tremendous authority in their power to determine who should and should not face trial.\&quot;\n\nOriginally, the Constitution of the United States made no provision for a grand jury. But the Fifth Amendment ratified in 1791, guaranteed that \&quot; ... no person shall be held to answer to a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger ... .\&quot; The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) made it illegal to deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Early California grand juries investigated local prisons, conducted audits of county books, and pursued matters of community interest.\n\nUnder statues passed in 1880 the duties of the grand jury extended to investigation of county government. Only in seven other states do grand juries investigate county government beyond cases of alleged misconduct on the part of public officials. The County of San Luis Obispo impanels a civil grand jury every year. Its term coincides with the county\'s fiscal year, July 1st-June 30th. Its jurisdiction extends to all government entities in the County except those under state and federal authority. Superior Court judges recommend candidates from among those who volunteer for service.\n\nA drawing of nineteen jurors and eleven alternates then ensues. A superior court judge swears in the jurors. The objective of this process is a grand jury of qualified citizens prepared to donate the time required to do a successful job. The function of the grand jury is primarily that of a watchdog, ensuring that local government is performing with efficiency, impartiality, honesty, and for the benefit of the community.\n\nThe citizens of the County of San Luis Obispo have a real asset in the grand jury. It provides them important information on how their county and local governments are conducting the peoples\' business. For the members of the jury the work is difficult and time-consuming, but in the end, quite satisfying.\n \n\nCivil vs. Criminal Grand Jury?\n\nThere is no such thing in California law as a \&quot;civil\&quot; grand jury. California has historically had only \&quot;regular\&quot; grand juries and every county is required by the California Constitution to have one every year.\n\nThe regular grand juries have always had two different functions: criminal and civil. One function, the criminal one, is to hear evidence to determine whether in the grand jury\'s view it is sufficient to warrant making an accused stand trial. Typically the District Attorney\'s office decides whom to accuse, on what charges and what evidence to bring to the attention of the grand jury. The District Attorney guides and advises the grand jury during its receipt of the evidence. The grand jury determines whether or not to issue an indictment. As discussed below, this indictment function has fallen into disuse in some, but not all, counties.\n\nIn addition to standard criminal indictment activity, potentially included within the criminal function is the obligation of every regular grand jury to investigate \&quot;willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Whether or not a grand jury\'s indictment function has fallen into disuse, this is a mandatory obligation and obviously may uncover criminal activity. The other function, the civil one, is to investigate local government agencies and officials to form a view as to whether they are acting properly. If a grand jury determines they are not, it has various options open to it.\n\nThe most frequently used option is the presentation of a report outlining the grand jury\'s findings and recommendations in the matter. Such reports are public and frequently attract media attention. They must be responded to in specific ways by the agencies or elected officials reported upon.\n\nExcept where an investigation is mandated, the grand jury in its sole discretion decides whether and what to investigate when performing its civil function. Depending on the nature and severity of any wrongdoing a grand jury finds in its investigations, it can, in addition to releasing a report, request the District Attorney to pursue the matter criminally, issue its own Accusation to start a court.\'\n\n[PC§§901: Standards of Judicial Administration §17(a) Cal. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 23.3; PC§919(c) Generally; PC§925-933.6; PC§933.05; and PC§919(b)]</field>

It was also during the reign of Henry II that juries divided into two types: civil and criminal, with the development of each influencing the other. The Massachusetts Bay Colony impaneled the first grand jury on our soil in 1635 to consider cases of murder, robbery and wife beating. By the end of the colonial period, the grand jury had become an important adjunct of government: &quot;they proposed new laws, protested against abuses in government, and wielded tremendous authority in their power to determine who should and should not face trial.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, the Constitution of the United States made no provision for a grand jury. But the Fifth Amendment ratified in 1791, guaranteed that &quot; ... no person shall be held to answer to a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger ... .&quot; The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) made it illegal to deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Early California grand juries investigated local prisons, conducted audits of county books, and pursued matters of community interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under statues passed in 1880 the duties of the grand jury extended to investigation of county government. Only in seven other states do grand juries investigate county government beyond cases of alleged misconduct on the part of public officials. The County of San Luis Obispo impanels a civil grand jury every year. Its term coincides with the county's fiscal year, July 1st-June 30th. Its jurisdiction extends to all government entities in the County except those under state and federal authority. Superior Court judges recommend candidates from among those who volunteer for service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drawing of nineteen jurors and eleven alternates then ensues. A superior court judge swears in the jurors. The objective of this process is a grand jury of qualified citizens prepared to donate the time required to do a successful job. The function of the grand jury is primarily that of a watchdog, ensuring that local government is performing with efficiency, impartiality, honesty, and for the benefit of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The citizens of the County of San Luis Obispo have a real asset in the grand jury. It provides them important information on how their county and local governments are conducting the peoples' business. For the members of the jury the work is difficult and time-consuming, but in the end, quite satisfying.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Civil vs. Criminal Grand Jury?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing in California law as a &quot;civil&quot; grand jury. California has historically had only &quot;regular&quot; grand juries and every county is required by the California Constitution to have one every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regular grand juries have always had two different functions: criminal and civil. One function, the criminal one, is to hear evidence to determine whether in the grand jury's view it is sufficient to warrant making an accused stand trial. Typically the District Attorney's office decides whom to accuse, on what charges and what evidence to bring to the attention of the grand jury. The District Attorney guides and advises the grand jury during its receipt of the evidence. The grand jury determines whether or not to issue an indictment. As discussed below, this indictment function has fallen into disuse in some, but not all, counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to standard criminal indictment activity, potentially included within the criminal function is the obligation of every regular grand jury to investigate &quot;willful or corrupt misconduct in office of public officers of every description within the county. Whether or not a grand jury's indictment function has fallen into disuse, this is a mandatory obligation and obviously may uncover criminal activity. The other function, the civil one, is to investigate local government agencies and officials to form a view as to whether they are acting properly. If a grand jury determines they are not, it has various options open to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequently used option is the presentation of a report outlining the grand jury's findings and recommendations in the matter. Such reports are public and frequently attract media attention. They must be responded to in specific ways by the agencies or elected officials reported upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except where an investigation is mandated, the grand jury in its sole discretion decides whether and what to investigate when performing its civil function. Depending on the nature and severity of any wrongdoing a grand jury finds in its investigations, it can, in addition to releasing a report, request the District Attorney to pursue the matter criminally, issue its own Accusation to start a court.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these fake communications made by email could contain an attachment or a link that &lt;span&gt;may install a virus or other spyware on the computer. Other communications make fraudulent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;demands to pay a fine or provide personal information, such as a Social Security number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to a jury summons, or for questions regarding your jury service, please go to&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/gi/jury.htm&quot;&gt;Jury Services&lt;/a&gt;. Or call the court’s juror services department at (805) 706-3610. Court and jury employees will never contact potential jurors by telephone to request any &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;personal or financial information over the telephone. The Court uses a vendor to collect on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;certain delinquent fees and fines. To confirm an inquiry about delinquent court‐ordered debt, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;you can call GC Services at 1-800-333-8395 (English) 1-800-511-0734 (Spanish), or visit their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://courtpay.gcserv.com&quot;&gt;https://courtpay.gcserv.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with questions about a suspicious communication that appears to be from San Luis Obispo Superior Court should contact the court. A list of phone numbers for all &lt;a href=&quot;/gi/contact-location.htm&quot;&gt;San Luis Obispo Superior Court locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is available online or by calling the court’s Public Information Office at (805) 706-3615.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check36&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get your Court Order to Change Name&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
At the hearing, the judge may either grant or deny your request to change your child’s name. If the judge grants the request to change name then the court clerk may give you a copy of the order on the day of the hearing or you will receive a copy of the order in the mail within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What is a Civil Harassment Restraining Order?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a court order that helps protect people from harassment by roommates, neighbors, co-workers or other people not close to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are being abused by your spouse or registered domestic partner, ex-spouse, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend or ex-girlfriend, parent, child, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, mother-in-law, son-in-law then you may request a &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-domesticviolence.htm&quot;&gt;Domestic Violence Restraining Order&lt;/a&gt;, not a Civil Harassment Restraining Order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Can I get one?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may obtain a civil harassment restraining order if you are worried about your safety because someone has stalked you, harassed you, sexually assaulted you or threatened you with violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What facts does the judge need to know about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your written declaration must state sufficient, detailed facts that show reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse. Your written declaration should contain dates, a detailed description of the recent abuse and a detailed description of any injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone you know also witnessed any incident, that person may submit a declaration describing the incident. If you have police reports, photographs, declarations by others or other supporting documents, attach a copy to your CH-100 Request for Orders, labeled as Exhibits and number each exhibit in your declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are requesting protection for another person, he or she must live in your household or be a family member. Your declaration must state the facts showing why that person also needs protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Court will grant or deny your request for temporary orders solely on the basis of your declaration. Your declaration must contain detailed facts based on your own knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In order to change your child’s name, the judge must find that changing your child's name is in the best interest of your child.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are involved in a family law case like parentage, child support, or child custody, and there hasn't been a final &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-glossary.htm#j&quot;&gt;judgment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; yet, you can ask that the name be changed as part of the family law case and you may not need to file a civil name change case. If you are not sure what type of case you should file, you should obtain legal advice from an attorney.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What's Needed To Change Your Child's Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both parents agree to change the child’s name and are filing the case together then both parents will need to complete and sign the following forms:&lt;/p&gt;

Both parents must go to court on the day of your scheduled hearing. You should bring to court the proof of publication from the newspaper if you did not previously file it with the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; Get your Court Order to Change Name&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How can a court clerk help me?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to help you if we can. However, we can do so only in certain way, since we must be fair to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a list of some things the court staff can and cannot do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Answering Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; explain and answer questions about how the court works.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; tell you whether or not you should bring your case to court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Paper Work &amp;amp; Legal Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; provide you with the number of the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://slobarlris.org/&quot;&gt;lawyer referral service&lt;/a&gt;, legal services program, &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-familylaw.htm&quot;&gt;family law facilitator program&lt;/a&gt;, and other service where you can get legal information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; check your papers for completeness - signatures, notarization, county name, case numbers, attachments.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; tell you what words to use in your court papers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Court Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; give you general information about court rules, procedures, and practices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; tell you what to say in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Your Case&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; provide court schedules and information on how to get a case scheduled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; give an opinion about what will happen if you bring your case to court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Case Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; provide you information from your case file, provide you with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm&quot;&gt;court forms&lt;/a&gt; and available instructions, and answer questions about court deadlines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; talk to the judge for you, let you talk to a judge outside of court, or change an order signed by a judge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been instructed not to answer questions if we do not know the correct answers, since court staff may not know the answers to all questions and because we don't want to give you wrong information, .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional information, please contact a lawyer or your local law library, or check the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp.htm&quot;&gt;California Courts Self-Help Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<field name="division">Criminal Law</field>
		<field name="body">All requests for information must include either a case number or the full name and date of birth.\n\nRequesting Copies of Court Records\n\nCopies of court records cost $0.50 / page. Matters stored off-site or requiring more than 10 minutes research will also carry a $15 file research fee. Most criminal case files are stored off site unless there is a pending court date. If certified copies are required, there is an additional charge of $25 per document to certify.\n\nYou will need the defendant\'s name and case number or the defendant\'s name and date of birth to make the request. This court only researches names with a case number or date of birth.  To maintain the confidentiality of our records and parties to court actions, the court is unable to confirm any other types of identifiers including Driver\'s License, Social Security number or address. The case number can be obtained by visiting or calling the court.\n\nRequesting records/information for one person\n\nMost information on a case can be obtained by requesting a case summary print out.  This document is available at a cost of $0.50/page at any of our court locations.   Defendants and attorneys of record can request copies of the case summary on a given case for free.  Victims can request copies of the case summary and/or copies of their protective orders on a given case for free.  These requests must be accompanied by proof of valid ID for the defendant, victim or a business/bar card for the attorney of record.  You can make this request either in person or by mail. This document can also be certified for a fee of $25 per case.  Our court considers this to be the most accurate and easy to read form of information for our cases.  Unless you need case information for Homeland Security, Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, for a formal hearing or have been specifically told that a case summary print out is unacceptable, then this may be the best option for you.\n\nRequesting a docket print out instead of copies of documents from a case file may streamline your request.\n\nComplete the Request for Case Information Form and mail or bring it in to the court with payment.  If you are requesting a case summary print out, you will also need to provide a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE).  A SASE is an envelope that you write your name and address and place proper postage (stamp) on it.  The envelope will then be used to mail your request back to you.  Please be sure to use a legal-sized envelope so your public docket will fit.  Further instructions are on the form.\n\nRequesting a case summary print out instead of copies of documents from a case file may streamline your request.\n\nPlease note that no requests can be made or sent by fax.\n\nRequesting records/information for more than one person (Bulk Request)\n\nIf you are requesting information for more than one person, please use the Request for Bulk Case Informationform. Use this type of request to perform searches on multiple names.  You may obtain case summary print outs at a cost of 50 cents per page, obtain a \&quot;no record\&quot; letter for names with no record and/or obtain a purge letter for cases that have been purged.  Please use the form to indicate your preferences.\n\nFill out the form completely.  Attach a list of names and dates of birth for individuals for whom you need to perform a background check or obtain dockets. To maintain the confidentiality of our records and parties to court actions, the court is unable to confirm any other types of identifiers including Driver\'s License, Social Security number or address. The clerk will search names exactly as they appear on your list.  If you need different variations of a name, please list them separately.  Please review the form for specific instructions. Submit the form along with payment in the form of a check made out to \&quot;SLO SUPERIOR COURT\&quot; in the basket provided at the Clerks\' office counter during regular business hours.\n \n\nResearch Procedure at the Counter (in person requests)\n\nDue to the on-going budget cuts and the Court’s current fiscal crisis, the Court will no longer be conducting background checks at the counter, effective June 1, 2012.\n\nIn order to reduce significant wait times for members of the public and in order to be able to retrieve, review and redact electronic records, pursuant to CRC Rule 2.507, any request for background research information must be submitted in writing, either at the counter or by mail.  The Court will no longer process these requests immediately at the counter.  The Court will process these requests on a first come-first serve basis, and you will be notified when your request is ready for pick up.  Research of 10 minutes or more will be charged at a rate of $15 for each 10-minute increment, as well as a $.50 per page charge for copies from the court file or copies of the case summary.\n\n A drop box is provided for these requests at the counter at the San Luis Obispo branch, 1050 Monterey Street, Rm. 220. The clerk will call once the request is complete and ready for pick-up.\n\nPlease alert the clerk if you are here to view, or have questions about, your personal court file or if you are the attorney of record for a defendant in a criminal or traffic matter.\n \n\nTranscripts\n\nCopies of transcripts must be ordered from the Court Reporter that reported the case. For information on obtaining copies of an official transcript please review the Purchasing a Transcript section of the Courtroom Operations Website.</field>

Matters stored off-site or requiring more than 10 minutes research will also carry a $15 file research fee. Most criminal case files are stored off site unless there is a pending court date. If certified copies are required, there is an additional charge of $25 per document to certify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need the defendant's name and case number &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the defendant's name and date of birth to make the request. This court only researches names with a case number or date of birth.  To maintain the confidentiality of our records and parties to court actions, the court is unable to confirm any other types of identifiers including Driver's License, Social Security number or address. The case number can be obtained by visiting or calling the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Requesting records/information for one person&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most information on a case can be obtained by requesting a case summary print out.  This document is available at a cost of $0.50/page at any of our court locations.   Defendants and attorneys of record can request copies of the case summary on a given case for free.  Victims can request copies of the case summary and/or copies of their protective orders on a given case for free.  These requests must be accompanied by proof of valid ID for the defendant, victim or a business/bar card for the attorney of record.  You can make this request either in person or by mail. This document can also be certified for a fee of $25 per case.  Our court considers this to be the most accurate and easy to read form of information for our cases.  Unless you need case information for Homeland Security, Immigration &amp;amp; Customs Enforcement, for a formal hearing or have been specifically told that a case summary print out is unacceptable, then this may be the best option for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requesting a docket print out instead of copies of documents from a case file may streamline your request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete the &lt;a href=&quot;/documents/san-luis-obispo/Request_Case_Info_3.pdf&quot;&gt;Request for Case Information Form&lt;/a&gt; and mail or bring it in to the court with payment.  If you are requesting a case summary print out, you will also need to provide a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE).  A SASE is an envelope that you write your name and address and place proper postage (stamp) on it.  The envelope will then be used to mail your request back to you.  Please be sure to use a legal-sized envelope so your public docket will fit.  Further instructions are on the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requesting a case summary print out instead of copies of documents from a case file may streamline your request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that no requests can be made or sent by fax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Requesting records/information for more than one person (Bulk Request)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are requesting information for more than one person, please use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slocourts.net/downloads/forms/criminal/Request_for_Bulk_Case_Information.pdf&quot;&gt;Request for Bulk Case Information&lt;/a&gt;form. Use this type of request to perform searches on multiple names.  You may obtain case summary print outs at a cost of 50 cents per page, obtain a &quot;no record&quot; letter for names with no record and/or obtain a purge letter for cases that have been purged.  Please use the form to indicate your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill out the form completely.  Attach a list of names and dates of birth for individuals for whom you need to perform a background check or obtain dockets. To maintain the confidentiality of our records and parties to court actions, the court is unable to confirm any other types of identifiers including Driver's License, Social Security number or address. The clerk will search names exactly as they appear on your list.  If you need different variations of a name, please list them separately.  Please review the form for specific instructions. Submit the form along with payment in the form of a check made out to &quot;SLO SUPERIOR COURT&quot; in the basket provided at the Clerks' office counter during regular business hours.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Research Procedure at the Counter (in person requests)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the on-going budget cuts and the Court’s current fiscal crisis, the Court will no longer be conducting background checks at the counter, &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; June 1, 2012.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce significant wait times for members of the public and in order to be able to retrieve, review and redact electronic records, pursuant to CRC Rule 2.507, any request for background research information must be submitted in writing, either at the counter or by mail.  The Court will no longer process these requests immediately at the counter.  The Court will process these requests on a first come-first serve basis, and you will be notified when your request is ready for pick up.  Research of 10 minutes or more will be charged at a rate of $15 for each 10-minute increment, as well as a $.50 per page charge for copies from the court file or copies of the case summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A drop box is provided for these requests at the counter at the San Luis Obispo branch, 1050 Monterey Street, Rm. 220. The clerk will call once the request is complete and ready for pick-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please alert the clerk if you are here to view, or have questions about, your personal court file or if you are the attorney of record for a defendant in a criminal or traffic matter.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transcripts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copies of transcripts must be ordered from the Court Reporter that reported the case. For information on obtaining copies of an official transcript please review the &lt;a href=&quot;/gi/court-reporter.htm#purchase&quot;&gt;Purchasing a Transcript&lt;/a&gt; section of the Courtroom Operations Website.&lt;/p&gt;

		<field name="headerh1">Finish a Divorce Case: Default Hearing Checklist</field>
		<field name="division">Family Law</field>
		<field name="body">1. Status of Marriage\n\nStandard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.  If you were married, then the judge will want to know if “irreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.” This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you. \n \n\n2. Child Custody and Visitation\n\nStandard:  Best Interest of Child.  If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.  If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don’t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.\n \n\n3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care\n\nMain Factors to Determine Child Support:  Dad’s Income, Mom’s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.\n\nIf you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at www.childsup.ca.gov.  In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.  Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent’s gross income before taxes.  If you tell the judge, “I don’t know what s/he makes,” then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.  Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.  For this reason, you can describe the other parent’s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.  The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent’s earnings. \n\nAt your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent’s employment even if they don’t have insurance now.  Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.  You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.\n\nIf you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.\n\nIf there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.\n \n\n4. Spousal Support\n\nMain Factors:  Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse\'s, or domestic partner\'s, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.\n\nIf you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.\n\nIf you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are “waiving” spousal support.  If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.  If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.\n\nIf you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to “terminate jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.  If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.\n\nIf you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to “reserve jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.\n \n\n5. Assets and Debts\n\nStandard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.  Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.  There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.  Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.\n\nIf there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.  If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.\n\nIf you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.  In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.\n \n\n6. Restoring of your Former Name\n\nIf you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.</field>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Status of Marriage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard: Irreconcilable differences have arisen.  If you were married, then the judge will want to know if “irreconcilable differences have arisen leading to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage.” This means that there has been a breakdown of the marriage and that no amount of counseling will reunite the two of you. &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Child Custody and Visitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard:  Best Interest of Child.  If there are minor children of the marriage, then you will want to explain to the judge what you want and why.  If you are requesting no or supervised visitation don’t forget to tell the judge why you believe your proposal is in the best interests of the child or children.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Child Support / Health insurance / Child Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Factors to Determine Child Support:  Dad’s Income, Mom’s Income, Percentage of Time each Parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to request a specific amount of child support at your default hearing, you may have the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator calculate the possible guideline child support amount or you may want to calculate it on your own at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.childsup.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;www.childsup.ca.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  In order to calculate child support you should bring a copy of your FL-150 Income and Expense Declaration.  Also, you will have to make an estimate for the judge as to the other parent’s gross income before taxes.  If you tell the judge, “I don’t know what s/he makes,” then the judge will have a difficult time making an order.  Remember, you know more about what the other parent earns or is able to earn than the judge does.  For this reason, you can describe the other parent’s occupation, experience, etc., and let the judge know what you believe the other parent is capable of earning.  The judge can then use this figure in setting the other parent’s earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At your hearing, you may also request an order that the other parent carry the minor children on health insurance available through the other parent’s employment even if they don’t have insurance now.  Note that the judge may make the same order for you that each of you carry the children on insurance that is available at no or reasonable cost through your employment.  You may also request that each parent pay one-half of any reasonable health care expenses that are not covered by the insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you incur child care expenses while you are at work or school, you may request that the other parent pay for one-half of any child care expenses incurred while you are at work or school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a case with the Department of Child Support Services, you will want to let the judge know this. Bring a copy of the child support order with you to your hearing. If the case is in another county, you will want to tell the judge the name of the other county where the DCSS case is located.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Spousal Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Factors:  Ability to Pay; Need for Support; Standard of Living During Marriage; Length of Marriage; Age and health of each spouse; How much income each can earn on their own; What the expenses of each spouse are; Whether there are minor children at home; The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage; What each person needs; What each person pays or can pay (including earnings and earning capacity); Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the minor children; Debts and property; Whether one spouse or domestic partner helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license; Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership; Whether one spouse's, or domestic partner's, career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home, and; The tax impact of spousal support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to request a specific amount of spousal support, you will need to tell the judge all the facts in your case that are related to the factors listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not ever want spousal support (now or in the future), then let the judge know you are “waiving” spousal support.  If you waive spousal support, you will never be able to ask for spousal support in the future, even if you need it.  If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not ever want to pay spousal support to the other party, then let the judge know that you want to “terminate jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.  If you have a marriage of 10 years or more the court will want you to explain why this is a reasonable request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the court to make spousal support orders in the future, then let the judge know that you want to “reserve jurisdiction” over the issue of spousal support.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Assets and Debts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard: Equal Division of Community Property and Debt.  Remember that community property is defined as any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after date of marriage and before date of separation.  There are some exceptions to this rule, such as gifts or inheritance.  Generally, in a default hearing the court wants to be able to divide that community property assets and debts equally between the parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are assets or debts to be divided by the judge, you should review the FL-160 Property Declaration(s) that you previously completed.  If you are requesting that the community property assets and debts be divided unequally, you will need to tell the judge why your unequal proposal for division is a fair and equitable division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are requesting that the court divide a pension or retirement plan then you may need to seek legal advice from an attorney before you get divorced. In most cases, the pension plan will not be able to disburse any money until a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is signed by the judge.  In addition, if the employee spouse dies before a QDRO is signed then the pension will not pay out any money to the spouse.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Restoring of your Former Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the judge to order that your name be restored to your former name, be sure to request this at the time of your hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Generally, if your spouse did not file a Response, then you may enter a default against him/her to request a default judgment that includes all the orders you requested in your Petition.  This instruction sheet will review the procedure and forms necessary to obtain a default judgment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before following these instructions you must satisfy the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-divorce-startcase.htm&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; a divorce, legal separation or annulment case by properly filing legal papers with the Court;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The other party was properly served with a copy of your legal papers and financial disclosure information;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You completed the Parenting Class if you have minor children of the marriage - &lt;a href=&quot;http://parenting.familieschange.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;http://parenting.familieschange.ca.gov/&lt;/a&gt; (805) 706-3608;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;30 days have passed from the date of service and the other party has not filed an FL-120 Response;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The other party is not an active duty military person;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are only requesting those items listed on the FL-100 Petition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to decide whether to proceed with or without a court hearing to obtain a Default Judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may obtain a default judgment by mail without appearing in front of a judge.  In other cases, you will need to schedule a hearing in front of the judge in order to finalize your case.  If you schedule a default hearing, the other party will not get notice of the default hearing, so only you will be present at the hearing.  At the default hearing the judge will make orders regarding all the issues in your case including the status of your marriage, custody and visitation of your children, child support, spousal support and division of assets and debts.  If you have questions about any of these issues you should contact an attorney or the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator for &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-familylaw.htm#facilitator&quot;&gt;further assistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following information will help you decide whether you need to schedule a default hearing or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annulment&lt;/strong&gt;: Schedule a default hearing if you are requesting an annulment. You must request a default hearing in front of a judicial officer and you should follow the hearing instructions below on how to request a default hearing;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restricted Visitation, Spousal Support, Unequal Division&lt;/strong&gt;:  Schedule a default hearing if you are requesting No or Supervised Visitation, Specific Amount of Spousal Support or Terminating Spousal Support in a 10+ year Marriage or Unequal Division of Property.  In these cases, it may be easier for the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator Office to help you if you request a default hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must choose one of the following Default Judgment options to finalize your case:&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-divorce-defaultnohearing.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;No Hearing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may obtain a domestic violence restraining order if a person has abused you and you have a close relationship with that person (married or registered domestic partners, divorced, separated, dating or used to date), or you are related (parent, child, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, in-law).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are being harassed by roommates, neighbors, co-workers or other people not close to you, then you may request a &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-civilrestraining.htm&quot;&gt;Civil Harassment Restraining Order&lt;/a&gt;, not a Domestic Violence Restraining Order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What facts does the judge need to know about?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your written declaration must state sufficient detailed facts that show reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.  Your written declaration should contain dates, a detailed description of the abuse and a detailed description of any injuries.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.  There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.  In some cases, a pension plan must be “joined” as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet (FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.  The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Preliminary &amp; Final Declaration of Disclosure\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            California law requires that you and your spouse give each other written information about all the income, expenses, assets and debts that you know to exist.  This act of revealing and making something known to the other person is called \&quot;disclosure.\&quot;  Disclosure is required at the beginning of the case (Preliminary) and end of the case (Final).  Disclosure is intended to make sure that you and your spouse are aware of everything each of you own and owe.  With this information you can divide your assets and debts equally, and can make reasonable decisions about support. If you leave anything out, either by mistake or on purpose, your property division may not be accepted by the court and your case may be reopened or changed.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Legal Custody\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare. One or both parents can have legal custody. If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Physical Custody\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent. If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody. If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called joint physical custody.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Visitation\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Visitation is the time that the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with.  There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule and (3) Supervised Visitation.  Reasonable visitation does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child. A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child. A specific visitation schedule defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child. A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child. Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child. A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.  You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.  Click here for more information on Supervised Visitation.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Child Support\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            To determine the amount of guideline child support that the Court may order in your case, visit www.childsup.ca.gov and click on Calculate Child Support.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Notice of Related Cases\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            If another cases exists that involves the same parties and issues like child custody, support or restraining orders then a Notice of Related Case should be filed.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Update Contact Information\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n            Parties must serve and file MC-040 Notice of Change of Address or Other Contact Information to keep each other and the court informed of their contact information.</field>

&lt;h3&gt;OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check5&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Complete Forms&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Complete all the forms listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check6&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Make Copies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the necessary forms are completed you should two hole-punch each original at the top and make two copies of the completed originals; one for you and one for the other party.  The originals are for the Court to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator's Office to review your forms before you file, then do not make copies until after the Center has reviewed your documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check8&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;File Papers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take to the Family Law Clerk's Office the completed originals and 2 copies including FL-110, FL-100, FL-160s, FL-311, FL-105, FL013 and FL-150 and if you are requesting a fee waiver FW-001 and FW-003.  Do not file the original FL-140.  Also do not file the ownership papers and account statements mentioned in the FL-160 Property Declarations. &lt;a href=&quot;/gi/contact-location.htm&quot;&gt; Courthouse Locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Family Law Clerk will assign a case number, file your originals and return the filed stamped copies to you. Your case number will be given to you at the time you file your case. Your case number will begin with the year your case was filed, followed by FL, followed by a series of numbers, e.g. 15FL1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Deliver Papers&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other party must receive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A copy of all the completed legal papers mentioned above (except fee waiver)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All ownership papers and account statements mentioned in the FL-160 Propery Declarations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Notice of Case Assignment (court clerk will give to you when you file)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl120.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-120&lt;/a&gt;  Response&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl140.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-140 &lt;/a&gt; Declaration of Disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl150.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-150 &lt;/a&gt; Income and Expense Declaration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl160.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-160&lt;/a&gt; Property Declaration&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl105.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-105&lt;/a&gt; Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act* (only if minor children)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person giving the other party these papers &lt;strong&gt;cannot be you&lt;/strong&gt; and must be 18 years or older. The person giving the other party these papers could be a friend, relative, private process server or the Sheriff's Department. This is called &quot;personal service&quot;.  It will be important to write down the date, time and address of when and where the documents were delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the other party won't take the papers, then the papers may be left at their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Complete FL-115 Proof of Service and FL-141 Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl115.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-115&lt;/a&gt; Proof of Service of Summons:  The person who gives the legal documents to the other party must sign and complete the  FL-115 Proof of Service of Summons and return it to you.  Do not give the other party the original FL-115 Proof of Service of Summons.  You should make a copy of the FL-115 Proof of Service of Summons for your own records and file the original with the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl141.pdf&quot;&gt;FL-141&lt;/a&gt; Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure and Income and Expense Declaration:  You must sign the FL-141 Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure to declare that the preliminary declaration of disclosure documents were given to the other party.  You should make a copy of the FL-141 Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclousre for your own records and file the original with the Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Wait 30 Days&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait 30 days after the papers were given to the other party.  After the 30 days, you will be able to decide how to proceed with your case.  There are several options on how to proceed with your case, but which options are available to you may depend on whether the other party files a Response.  The other party has a minimum of 30 days from the date of service to file their Response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the other party files a Response, a copy of it should be mailed to you. To check that a Response was not filed you may go to the Clerk's Office at the Courthouse or call (805) 706-3600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Attend Parenting Class&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are minor children of the marriage, you must complete an online parenting class, &lt;a href=&quot;http://parenting.familieschange.ca.gov/&quot;&gt;Parenting After Separation&lt;/a&gt;, that deals with the impact of divorce and/or separation on children.  The online parenting class is free. For more information about the class you may call Family Court Services at (805) 706-3608.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This program satisfies the Court's requirements for parent education prior to receiving final orders. When you complete the class after registering online, you will be immediately emailed a certificate of completion. Simply file this certificate with the court in San Luis Obispo at 1035 Palm Street, Rm 385 or at the Paso Robles Branch at 901 Park Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=&quot;Check34&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Finish Case&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more forms that you must complete and file before your case is finalized.  You may proceed with your case in one of three different ways: Default, Uncontested or by Trial.  You or the other party must file additional documents in order for your case to be final.  The court will not contact you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have completed the steps to start your case, you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-divorce-finishcase.htm&quot;&gt;finish your case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Petitioner &amp;amp; Respondent
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;If you are filing the Petition you will always be the Petitioner in this case and the other party will be called the Respondent.&lt;/p&gt;

            Date of Separation
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Date of separation is the date that in your mind you knew the marriage/domestic partnership was over and you did something to show that you no longer wanted to be together.&lt;/p&gt;

            Separate Property
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Separate property is any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred before your date of marriage/domestic partnership or after your date of separation and will be listed on your FL-160 Separate Property Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

            Community Property
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Community property is any asset or debt that was purchased or incurred after your date of marriage/domestic partnership and before your date of separation and will be listed on your FL-160 Community Property Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

            Pension Retirement Plans
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;A pension can be more valuable than any other asset acquired during the marriage or domestic partnership, including a house. It may be worth more than all of the other assets put together.  There are very specific and technical rules that apply to pensions and you should get legal advice from a lawyer in order to protect your interest in the pension.  In some cases, a pension plan must be “joined” as a party in your divorce case before a judge will issue an order about how the pension will be divided. Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl318info.pdf&quot;&gt;Retirement Plan Joinder - Information Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(FL-318-INFO) for more information about whether the pension plan must be joined in your divorce case.  The court order that details how a pension will be divided is called a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. The QDRO must be approved by both the benefits provider and the judge to assure that the spouse/partner that is not the employee of the company or organization will receive those future benefits. A QDRO is an extremely complicated legal document and if you make a mistake, there can be harmful results.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a role=&quot;button&quot; data-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; data-parent=&quot;#accordion&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;acc2474&quot; href=&quot;#acc2474&quot;&gt;
            Preliminary &amp;amp; Final Declaration of Disclosure
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;California law requires that you and your spouse give each other written information about all the income, expenses, assets and debts that you know to exist.  This act of revealing and making something known to the other person is called &quot;disclosure.&quot;  Disclosure is required at the beginning of the case (Preliminary) and end of the case (Final).  Disclosure is intended to make sure that you and your spouse are aware of everything each of you own and owe.  With this information you can divide your assets and debts equally, and can make reasonable decisions about support. If you leave anything out, either by mistake or on purpose, your property division may not be accepted by the court and your case may be reopened or changed.&lt;/p&gt;

            Legal Custody
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare. One or both parents can have legal custody. If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.&lt;/p&gt;

            Physical Custody
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent. If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody. If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called joint physical custody.&lt;/p&gt;

            Visitation
        &lt;/a&gt;








            &lt;p&gt;Visitation is the time that the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with.  There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule and (3) Supervised Visitation.  Reasonable visitation does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child. A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child. A specific visitation schedule defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child. A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child. Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child. A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.  You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.  Click here for more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/1190.htm&quot;&gt;Supervised Visitation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

forms.\n	 \n\n\n\n\nWhat Orders Can You Request\n\nLegal Custody: Legal custody deals with the parents’ right to make the decisions relating to the child’s health, education and welfare.  One or both parents can have legal custody.  If both parents are making decisions about the child it is called joint legal custody.  When writing your declaration you need to explain why it is in the child’s best interest for one or both parents to make these decisions.\n\nPhysical Custody: Physical custody deals with the days and times that the child will spend with each parent.  If the child primarily lives with one parent it is called physical custody.  If you are requesting that both parents spend a substantial period of time with the child, it is called Joint Physical Custody.  When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed physical custody request is in the child’s best interest.\n\nVisitation: Visitation is the time the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.  When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child’s best interest.  There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.  Reasonable visitation does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.  A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.  A specific visitation schedule defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.  A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.  Supervised Visitation requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.  A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.  You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.  Click here for more information on Supervised Visitation.\n\nPrevent Child Abduction:  If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.  When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.\n\nChild Support:  Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.  Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.  The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.  The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad’s gross monthly income (2) Mom’s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.  When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.  The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.  Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent’s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.  You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.  Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.  Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator to calculate the child support amount on your own.\n\nSpousal Support:  (formerly known as “ALIMONY”):  The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.  The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.  Some of the factors the judge will consider are:  (1) Spouse’s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse’s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.  When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.  The judge needs to know what you think your spouse’s income is and how you arrived at that number.  In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse\'s career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.\n\nAttorney\'s Fees and Costs:  You may request that the other party pay for your attorney’s fees and costs.  The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.  When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney’s fees and costs.\n\nProperty Restraint:  You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K’s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.  When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.\n\nProperty Control:  You may request an order giving you permission to use a car or live in the house.  Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.\n\nOther Relief:  You may request any other relief not already covered.  For example, you may request to (1) set aside default (2) change venue (3) reimbursement of half of uninsured health care expenses.  Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.\n \n\nCosts Involved\n\nFiling Fee: $60 filing fee for the regular Request for Order. There is an additional fee of $25 to modify child custody or visitation orders. There is an additional fee of $60 to request an ex parte hearing.  The court will also charge a first appearance fee of $435 if it was not previously paid or waived. If you wish a record made of the proceedings, you must provide your own court reporter. If you do not have a court reporter present at your hearing, you will not be able to request a transcript of your hearing in the future. If you need assistance in obtaining a court-approved list of pro tem reporters, contact the supervising court reporter at (805) 781-1132\n\nFee Waiver: If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you may obtain the forms to apply for a fee waiver at any of our Courthouses or you may click the links below.

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;REGULAR REQUEST vs. EX PARTE REQUEST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a family law case opened, you may file a Request for Order to obtain temporary orders or modify court orders.  Types of family law cases that you may file a Request for Order into include: &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-divorce.htm&quot;&gt;Divorce, Legal Separation, Nullity&lt;/a&gt;, Petition to Establish Parental Relationship, Petition for Custody and Support, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/1201.htm&quot;&gt;Local Child Support Agency - Complaint Regarding Parental Obligations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/sh/selfhelp-domesticviolence.htm&quot;&gt;Domestic Violence Prevention Act&lt;/a&gt;.  You may request a hearing in any of these cases.  A Request for Order is an optional step and is not required to obtain a final judgment in your dissolution of marriage, legal separation, nullity or paternity case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have a family law case opened, you may not file a Request for Order.  To learn more about how to open a family law case you may click on a type of case listed above or visit the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you will obtain a hearing date within 30 days from the date you file your Request for Order documents. If you have an emergency and need emergency temporary orders before your hearing date in 30 days, then you may consider filing an Ex Parte Request for Order. An Ex Parte Request for Order requires additional forms and procedures from a regular Request for Order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex Parte Request for Order are for emergencies only. Generally, an emergency is when there is or likely will be “blood on the floor.” This means that there is actual harm taking place or it is likely that if the court does not make an emergency order there will be harm.&lt;/p&gt;

Examples of emergencies are:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The other parent has taken the child, threatened that he/she will leave the state and hide, and you actually believe that they will do so. You need an ex parte order that returns the child to you and prevents him from leaving the area with the child.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your child needs emergency medical treatment that requires both parents’ consent and the other side refuses to give consent. You need an ex parte order that allows you to have the authority to give consent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The other parent has just been charged with child abuse or child molestation of your child, and there is a visitation order in effect that allows visitation for the coming weekend. You need an ex parte order that prevents visitation pending a full hearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless there is a showing of immediate harm to the child or immediate risk that the child will be removed from the State of California, the judge may properly deny your request.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Importance of the Declaration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The declaration is a persuasive document that provides the judge as much detail as you can give and is a very important part of your case. If you are requesting emergency ex parte orders, your declaration must explain what the emergency is. Your declaration must explain all the reasons the court should grant the orders you are requesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is your job to give the judge facts, details, dates, description of events, etc. so the judge can reach the conclusion that is most favorable to you. In your declaration, you must answer the question about why the judge should grant the orders you are requesting. On the day of the hearing, you may forget to tell the judge your whole story. So, all the facts and details you want the judge to consider should be stated in your declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your declaration may be up to 10 pages long, doubled spaced using 12 point font. When writing or typing your declaration, keep in mind the judge will have to read this and refer to it at your hearing. Use descriptive headings for your paragraphs. This should tell the judge what the paragraph is about. You should start with the most important issue and the most recent event. When the judge is finished reading your declaration there should be no doubt about what you want, why you want it and why the judge should do what you want.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Attaching Documents (Exhibits)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibits are documents that support something you are saying in your declaration. If you believe there are documents the judge should read, you may attach them to your declaration. You must properly describe the document in your declaration by stating what the document is, what exhibit number you have assigned it and why the document is important for the judge to consider, e.g. “Attached as Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of my paystubs for the last 3 months showing my gross monthly income is $1550.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visitation&lt;/strong&gt;: Visitation is the time the child spends with the parent who does not primarily live with the child.  When writing your declaration you need to explain why your proposed visitation schedule is in the child’s best interest.  There are several options to choose from when it comes to visitation, generally they are: (1) Reasonable Visitation (2) Specific Visitation Schedule (3) Supervised Visitation.  &lt;em&gt;Reasonable visitation&lt;/em&gt; does not define the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.  A reasonable visitation court order usually works when both parents are in agreement about the time share that each is to have with the child.  A &lt;em&gt;specific visitation schedule&lt;/em&gt; defines the days and times that each parent will have physical custody of the child.  A specific visitation schedule may be necessary for parents who have a difficult time agreeing on the days and times that each parent will spend with the child.  &lt;em&gt;Supervised Visitation&lt;/em&gt; requires that a responsible adult be present during any visitation times with the child.  A supervised visitation order may be necessary if there are reasonable concerns that a parent may harm the child if left alone.  You may request a non-professional or professional supervisor.  Click here for more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courts.ca.gov/1190.htm&quot;&gt;Supervised Visitation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent Child Abduction&lt;/strong&gt;:  If there are facts that show that the other parent may be thinking of taking the child and hiding the child from you, then you may request orders to prevent the other parent from abducting the child.  When writing your declaration you need to explain what the other party has done or plans to do to take and hide the child from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Child Support&lt;/strong&gt;:  Both parents are required to financially support the minor child.  Child support is the amount of money that one parent pays to the other to equalize the financial responsibility.  The amount of child support is arrived by inputting several numbers into a formula.  The main factors that are taken into consideration are: (1) Dad’s gross monthly income (2) Mom’s gross monthly income and (3) Percentage of time that is spent with the child.  When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.  The judge needs to know what you are claiming each of these numbers is and also how you arrived at those numbers.  Other facts that may be discussed in your declaration are: (1) the other parent’s ability to earn income, (2) the number of other biological children living with you (3) the amount of child care costs per month (4) the amount of rental income received (5) the amount of property taxes and mortgage interest paid per month and (6) the amount paid per month for health insurance premiums.  You may attach any supporting documentation to your declaration as exhibits.  Be prepared for what the amount of child support might be.  Before you file your OSC, the Self-Help Center / Family Law Facilitator may help you calculate the amount of child support or you may go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator&quot;&gt;https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator&lt;/a&gt; to calculate the child support amount on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spousal Support&lt;/strong&gt;:  (formerly known as “ALIMONY”):  The judge has discretion to order the payment of spousal support.  The judge will consider several factors before deciding whether to award spousal support, the amount of spousal support and the length of time that spousal support will be received.  Some of the factors the judge will consider are:  (1) Spouse’s ability to pay spousal support (2) Other spouse’s need to receive spousal support and (3) Standard of living during your marriage.  When writing your declaration, you must address each of these factors.  The judge needs to know what you think your spouse’s income is and how you arrived at that number.  In addition, your declaration must give details that describe your standard of living during the marriage which may include the number and kinds of vacations you took together, the kind of home you lived in, the kind of cars you owned, etc.Other factors that you may include in your declaration are the following: (1) Length of marriage (2) Age and health of each spouse (3) How much income each spouse can earn on their own (4) What the expenses of each spouse are (5) The history of the way the couple handled money during the marriage (6) Whether having a job would make it too hard to take care of the children (7) Whether one spouse helped the other get an education, training, career, or professional license (8) Whether there was domestic violence in the marriage or domestic partnership and (9) Whether one spouse's career was affected by unemployment, or by taking care of the children or home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attorney's Fees and Costs&lt;/strong&gt;:  You may request that the other party pay for your attorney’s fees and costs.  The judge has discretion to grant or deny this request.  When writing your declaration, you must establish in sufficient detail that the other party has the financial ability to pay your attorney’s fees and costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property Restraint&lt;/strong&gt;:  You may request that the other party be prohibited from cashing out 401K’s, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.  When writing your declaration, you must describe why this order is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property Control&lt;/strong&gt;:  You may request an order giving you permission to use a car or live in the house.  Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Relief&lt;/strong&gt;:  You may request any other relief not already covered.  For example, you may request to (1) set aside default (2) change venue (3) reimbursement of half of uninsured health care expenses.  Your declaration must describe why this order is necessary.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Costs Involved&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filing Fee&lt;/strong&gt;: $60 filing fee for the regular Request for Order. There is an additional fee of $25 to modify child custody or visitation orders. There is an additional fee of $60 to request an ex parte hearing.  The court will also charge a first appearance fee of $435 if it was not previously paid or waived. If you wish a record made of the proceedings, you must provide your own court reporter. If you do not have a court reporter present at your hearing, you will not be able to request a transcript of your hearing in the future. If you need assistance in obtaining a court-approved list of pro tem reporters, contact the supervising court reporter at (805) 781-1132&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your warrant has a specific bail amount assigned, you may post bail to clear your warrant and receive a court date.  You may post bail at the court or at any law enforcement agency.  If your warrant states &quot;NO BAIL&quot;, then this is not an option for this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cash Bail&lt;/h4&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Request Court Surrender/Calendar date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an outstanding warrant you or your attorney may request the clerk to calendar your warrant matter(s) for hearing by appearing at the Criminal counter in San Luis Obispo.  Calendaring your case does NOT recall the warrant.  Your warrant will be addressed by a judge on your court date.  You can calendar your case by calling the court or by appearing at the clerk's counter during normal business hours. Our phones are open M-TH, Counters M-F 8:30AM - 4:00PM.  The clerk will verify that your case qualifies for &quot;court surrender&quot; and will calendar your case for two weeks in the future on an appropriate court date.  If your warrant is the result of a Prop 36 case, this option is not available to you.  If your warrant was ordered as &quot;no court surrender&quot;, this option is not available to you.  To check if your warrant is for a Prop 36 case or states &quot;no court surrender&quot; please contact the court in person or by calling (805) 781-5670.&lt;/p&gt;
