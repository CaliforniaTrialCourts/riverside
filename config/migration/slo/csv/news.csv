18,Press Release,,,Memo - Designation of Complex Cases,"<p>The Court wishes to inform you that effective immediately, the San Luis&nbsp;Obispo County Superior Court will begin reviewing all civil case files for the&nbsp;purpose of identifying those cases that should be designated as a “complex case”.&nbsp;Complex cases must be designated by the plaintiff or defendant or jointly on the&nbsp;Civil Case Cover Sheet as provided by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.401-3.402. The Court is audited by the state for case types and procedures that affect&nbsp;the budget of the court and the allocation of judicial resources. In these tight&nbsp;budgetary times, our Court finds it necessary to more strictly enforce the Rules of&nbsp;Court regarding case types.</p>

<p>Each judge to whom civil cases are assigned shall &nbsp;determine (with or&nbsp;without a hearing) whether or not the case should be designated as complex&nbsp;pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.403. &nbsp;If the matter is designated as&nbsp;complex, and if all parties have not yet paid the complex case fee required by&nbsp;Government Code &sect;26826.4, the Court shall order payment of that fee.</p>

<p>The Court will make every effort to determine whether a case is complex as&nbsp;soon as feasible after a case is filed. The judge &nbsp;assigned to the case has the&nbsp;continuing power, pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.403(b), to decide&nbsp;on its own motion or on noticed motion of any party, that a civil action is a&nbsp;complex case or that an action previously declared &nbsp;to be a complex case is not a&nbsp;complex case.</p>

<p>The Court would appreciate the cooperation and assistance of the lawyers&nbsp;appearing before us in properly designating complexcases.<br />
